development
    test while statements and function calls


bugs
    last few semicolons not being tokenized
        they are tokenized if manually step-through in debug
        they are not tokenized if program executed or debug goes through them without manual stepping
        
        how to replicate issue:
            observe that on simple execution,
                ; is not a token after 2018
                ; is not a token after the last fi in the program
            now set breakpoints and manually step through line by line for the moments where these tokens are being tokenized
                observe that ; will be tokenized
