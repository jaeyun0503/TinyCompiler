    generating and emitting SSA
        while-do
            bugs
                variable names overwriting themselves in while-do-od in the case where multiple variables intially share the same ssa value
                

            current
                implement ssa generation
                    while do
                        yuja ep 3, 60 minutes
                    generate diverged instruction methods:
                        "on the fly now"
                        before eliminating an instruction, you create a dummy instruction that is not counted as deleted
                    idea: every instruction has a weak queue for variable associations
    
    function calls


bugs
    [SOLVED] last few semicolons not being tokenized
        resolution: loading file contents into a string to work with rather than using file pointers
        cause: something wrong with python file pointers (seek, tell methods)
        they are tokenized if manually step-through in debug
        they are not tokenized if program executed or debug goes through them without manual stepping
        
        how to replicate issue:
            observe that on simple execution,
                ; is not a token after 2018
                ; is not a token after the last fi in the program
            now set breakpoints and manually step through line by line for the moments where these tokens are being tokenized
                observe that ; will be tokenized
